                <h3>About Myself</h3>
                <p>I am a 23 year old student living in Vancouver and studying communications at KPU. I recently discovered a great love for programming, web development in particular, and have decided to shift my focus to becoming the best developer I can be. On this site you will find some details about my interests and hobbies, along with links to any work that I have deployed.</p>

                <h3>Hobbies and interests</h3>
                <h6>What do I love to do</h6>
                <p>In my spare time I find myself pulled towards friends and family. I enjoy all kinds of social activities with them; these include, playing board games, hiking, hunting, volleyball, great conversation, and church activities. I also spend a large amount of my spare time teaching myself web development and working on making sites like this one. Lastly and most importantly, I spend my evenings talking to my fiance who lives in New Zealand. She is moving to Vancouver in late 2018, and we are both extremely excited.</p>

                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <h6>E3 Eco Group</h6>
                <p>Currently I am employed part time at E3 Eco Group as an energy modeler. I work to profile new and old buildings in order to determine how energy efficient they are. The work is interesting and unique with no two jobs being exactly the same. I work mostly from home with only the occasional visit to the main office.</p>

                <h3>Languages and Technologies</h3>
                <h6>What can I work with</h6>
                <p>The languages and technologies that I understand include: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, Sass, and JavaScript. I am constantly improving my abilities using websites such as Udemy and Lynda.com, along with YouTube tutorials, forum posts, experimentation and reading documentation. I am currently cementing my skills in JavaScript ES6+ syntax, and then I plan to begin learning React.js followed by Node.js. Long term I hope to be able to add Python, PHP, Angular, Materialize CSS, and many more to my list of skills.</p>
